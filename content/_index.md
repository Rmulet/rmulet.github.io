Computational biologist with a focus on transcriptional regulation, cancer and hematology. I have 6 years of experience as a bioinformatician working with genomics and epigenomics data, using programming and data science skills that complement a strong background in molecular biology. During this period, I have been involved in various projects, either as a lead researcher or in a support position. Aside from the purely analytical tasks, I thoroughly enjoy discussions about the underlying scientific questions. 

I'm passionate about science and evidence-based medicine, and also interested in technology, history and economics.

Currently conducting postdoctoral research at Erasmus MC, Rotterdam (The Netherlands).
