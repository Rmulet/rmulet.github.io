      <description>Blood comprises a wide array of specialized cells, all of which share the same genetic information and ultimately derive from the same precursor, the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). This diversity of phenotypes is underpinned by unique transcriptional programs gradually acquired in the process known as hematopoiesis. Spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression depends on many factors, but critical among them are enhancersâ€”sequences of DNA that bind transcription factors and increase transcription of genes under their control.</description>

      <title> Induced cell-autonomous neutropenia systemically perturbs hematopoiesis in Cebpa enhancer-null mice </title>

      <description>The transcription factor C/EBPa initiates the neutrophil gene expression program in the bone marrow (BM). Knockouts of the Cebpa gene or its +37kb enhancer in mice show 2 major findings: (1) neutropenia in BM and blood; (2) decrease in long-term hematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC) numbers. Whether the latter finding is cell-autonomous (intrinsic) to the LT-HSCs or an extrinsic event exerted on the stem cell compartment remained an open question. Flow cytometric analysis of the Cebpa +37kb enhancer knockout model revealed that the reduction in LT-HSC numbers observed was proportional to the degree of neutropenia.</description>
