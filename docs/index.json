[{"categories":null,"contents":"Leukemias with ambiguous lineage comprise several loosely defined entities, often without a clear mechanistic basis. Here, we extensively profile the epigenome and transcriptome of a subgroup of such leukemias with CpG Island Methylator Phenotype. These leukemias exhibit comparable hybrid myeloid/lymphoid epigenetic landscapes, yet heterogeneous genetic alterations, suggesting they are defined by their shared epigenetic profile rather than common genetic lesions. Gene expression enrichment reveals similarity with early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and a lymphoid progenitor cell of origin. In line with this, integration of differential DNA methylation and gene expression shows widespread silencing of myeloid transcription factors. Moreover, binding sites for hematopoietic transcription factors, including CEBPA, SPI1 and LEF1, are uniquely inaccessible in these leukemias. Hypermethylation also results in loss of CTCF binding, accompanied by changes in chromatin interactions involving key transcription factors. In conclusion, epigenetic dysregulation, and not genetic lesions, explains the mixed phenotype of this group of leukemias with ambiguous lineage. The data collected here constitute a useful and comprehensive epigenomic reference for subsequent studies of acute myeloid leukemias, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias and mixed-phenotype leukemias.\n","permalink":"https://rmulet.github.io/publications/natcom2024.html","tags":["Leukemia","Epigenetics","MPAL","ALAL","DNA methylation"],"title":"Epigenetic alterations affecting hematopoietic regulatory networks as drivers of mixed myeloid/lymphoid leukemia"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Blood comprises a wide array of specialized cells, all of which share the same genetic information and ultimately derive from the same precursor, the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). This diversity of phenotypes is underpinned by unique transcriptional programs gradually acquired in the process known as hematopoiesis. Spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression depends on many factors, but critical among them are enhancersâ€”sequences of DNA that bind transcription factors and increase transcription of genes under their control. Thus, hematopoiesis involves the activation of specific enhancer repertoires in HSCs and their progeny, driving the expression of sets of genes that collectively determine morphology and function. Disruption of this tightly regulated process can have catastrophic consequences: in hematopoietic malignancies, dysregulation of transcriptional control by enhancers leads to misexpression of oncogenes that ultimately drive transformation. This review attempts to provide a basic understanding of enhancers and their role in transcriptional regulation, with a focus on normal and malignant hematopoiesis. We present examples of enhancers controlling master regulators of hematopoiesis and discuss the main mechanisms leading to enhancer dysregulation in leukemia and lymphoma.\n","permalink":"https://rmulet.github.io/publications/reviewenhancers2023.html","tags":["Enhancers","Hematopoiesis","Transcription","Blood"],"title":"From Genotype to Phenotype: How Enhancers Control Gene Expression and Cell Identity in Hematopoiesis"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The transcription factor C/EBPa initiates the neutrophil gene expression program in the bone marrow (BM). Knockouts of the Cebpa gene or its +37kb enhancer in mice show 2 major findings: (1) neutropenia in BM and blood; (2) decrease in long-term hematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC) numbers. Whether the latter finding is cell-autonomous (intrinsic) to the LT-HSCs or an extrinsic event exerted on the stem cell compartment remained an open question. Flow cytometric analysis of the Cebpa +37kb enhancer knockout model revealed that the reduction in LT-HSC numbers observed was proportional to the degree of neutropenia. Single-cell transcriptomics of wild-type (WT) mouse BM showed that Cebpa is predominantly expressed in early myeloid-biased progenitors but not in LT-HSCs. These observations suggest that the negative effect on LT-HSCs is an extrinsic event caused by neutropenia. We transplanted whole BMs from +37kb enhancer-deleted mice and found that 40% of the recipient mice acquired full-blown neutropenia with severe dysplasia and a significant reduction in the total LT-HSC population. The other 60% showed initial signs of myeloid differentiation defects and dysplasia when they were sacrificed, suggesting they were in an early stage of the same pathological process. This phenotype was not seen in mice transplanted with WT BM. Altogether, these results indicate that Cebpa enhancer deletion causes cell-autonomous neutropenia, which reprograms and disturbs the quiescence of HSCs, leading to a systemic impairment of the hematopoietic process.\n","permalink":"https://rmulet.github.io/publications/bloodadvances2022.html","tags":["CEBPA","Hematopoiesis","HSCs","Enhancers"],"title":" Induced cell-autonomous neutropenia systemically perturbs hematopoiesis in Cebpa enhancer-null mice "},{"categories":null,"contents":"Transcriptional deregulation is a central event in the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To identify potential disturbances in gene regulation, we conducted an unbiased screen of allele-specific expression (ASE) in 209 AML cases. The gene encoding GATA binding protein 2 (GATA2) displayed ASE more often than any other myeloid- or cancer-related gene. GATA2 ASE was strongly associated with CEBPA double mutations (DMs), with 95% of cases presenting GATA2 ASE. In CEBPA DM AML with GATA2 mutations, the mutated allele was preferentially expressed. We found that GATA2 ASE was a somatic event lost in complete remission, supporting the notion that it plays a role in CEBPA DM AML. Acquisition of GATA2 ASE involved silencing of 1 allele via promoter methylation and concurrent overactivation of the other allele, thereby preserving expression levels. Notably, promoter methylation was also lost in remission along with GATA2 ASE. In summary, we propose that GATA2 ASE is acquired by epigenetic mechanisms and is a prerequisite for the development of AML with CEBPA DMs. This finding constitutes a novel example of an epigenetic hit cooperating with a genetic hit in the pathogenesis of AML.\n","permalink":"https://rmulet.github.io/publications/blood2021.html","tags":["ASE","Epigenetics","AML","GATA2","CEBPA"],"title":"Allele-specific expression of GATA2 due to epigenetic dysregulation in CEBPA double-mutant AML "},{"categories":null,"contents":"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with inv(3)/t(3;3)(q21q26) is a distinct World Health Organization recognized entity, characterized by its aggressive course and poor prognosis.

If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.\nFirst it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty \u0026lsquo;man in the middle\u0026quot; attack. Finally it gives your site that touch of class\u0026hellip;. which of course a classy person like yourself relies on. Once you implement SSL certificates on your server you\u0026rsquo;ll want to require secure connections using Apache\u0026rsquo;s rewrite module. Now I won\u0026rsquo;t dwell on the creation and signing of certificates, its already well documented.Â If your just starting out though,heres a few links I recommend;\nCreating self-signed certificates (free, but should only be used internally or for testing, users will; see an \u0026lsquo;Untrusted\u0026quot; warning) Requesting a CA Signed certificate (not free, but the final certificate is trusted and seamless for users) The second link uses the schools internal CA, you will need to pay a public CA like Entrust or Verisign. All of this information is aimed at \u0026rsquo;nix or solaris servers running apache. Why? cause a production windows server is laughable :-p\nNow that you have a certificate, whats next? So there you are you have a shiny new Certificate and Server key, how do you force visitors to your apache driven site to use the SSL? You copied the certificates into the appropite locations right? And you have made the needed changes in httpd.conf right? So now when you view https://example.com you see a \u0026rsquo;trusted\u0026rsquo; warning or your site right? If No to any of these than this article does a pretty good job of outlining those steps.\nThe SSL Works, How do I force connections to use it? First you need to decide if you want to force every page on your site to use SSL, or only a particular sub-domain, or maybe just your admin directory.Â Since the overhead is minimal there is no harm is forcing the entire domain to leverage SSL, but if it is a self-signed certificate for your personal use than you\u0026rsquo;ll most certainly want to restrict its use to your own areas. This prevents users from seeing that nasty warning \u0026ldquo;This server is not trusted\u0026rdquo; You\u0026rsquo;ll know if your using SSL because the url prefix changes from http to https (s for secure).\nForcing entire domain to use SSL You want any visit, any where to use ssl. This probably the simplest solution. Create or append to your htaccess file in the top directory of your server. Some people use a port check (80 is typically http, while 443 is https) but if you have alernate configs or the user just adds :8080 to the end of the url this method is useless. Instead check whether the https environmental variable is set, if not then redirect.\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}$1 \\[R,L\\] Forcing sub-domains to use SSL Maybe you only want mysecretarea.example.com to use SSL, that\u0026rsquo;s easy enough. Its the same premise as above, but you move the htaccess file into the directory that corresponds to the subdomain. Also change the second line like below;\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://mysecretarea.%{SERVER_NAME}$1 \\[R,L\\] Forcing a directory to use SSL This method cn get a little hairier if your using aliases or redirects on top of this one. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to consider what order the commands are read. The basic principle is like so.Â You want all visits to example.com/admin to use ssl. Create a htaccess file in the parent directory.Â Again will check for the https variable, but this time we also check for the sub-directory to be in the path.\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on RewriteRule ^/admin/(.*)$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}/admin/$1 \\[R,L\\] ","permalink":"https://rmulet.github.io/blog/force-ssl.html","tags":["apache","apache","redirect","rewrite","ssl","web development"],"title":"Forcing Visits to use SSL"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Multiple plugins used by thousands of teams that provide enhanced functionality of Atlassianâ€™s core products (primarily JIRA and Bamboo) to enrich CI/CD capabilities, DevOps automation, or productivity.
